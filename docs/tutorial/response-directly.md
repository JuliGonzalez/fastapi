When you create a **FastAPI** *path operation* you can normally return any data from it: a `dict`, a `list`, a Pydantic model, a database model, etc.

By default, **FastAPI** would automatically convert that return value to JSON using the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/encoder/" target="_blank">`jsonable_encoder`</a>.

Then, behind the scenes, it would put that JSON-compatible data (e.g. a `dict`) inside of a Starlette `JSONResponse` that would be used to send the response to the client.

But you can return a `JSONResponse` directly from your *path operations*.

It might be useful, for example, to return custom headers or cookies.

## Starlette `Response`

In fact, you can return any <a href="https://www.starlette.io/responses/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette `Response`</a> or any sub-class of it.

!!! tip
    `JSONResponse` itself is a sub-class of `Response`.

And when you return a Starlette `Response`, **FastAPI** will pass it directly.

It won't do any data conversion with Pydantic models, it won't convert the contents to any type, etc.

This gives you a lot of flexibility. You can return any data type, override any data declaration or validation, etc.

## Using the `jsonable_encoder` in a `Response`

Because **FastAPI** doesn't do any change to a `Response` you return, you have to make sure it's contents are ready for it.

For example, you cannot put a Pydantic model in a `JSONResponse` without first converting it to a `dict` with all the data types (like `datetime`, `UUID`, etc) converted to JSON-compatible types.

For those cases, you can use the `jsonable_encoder` to convert your data before passing it to a response:

```Python hl_lines="4 6 20 21"
{!./src/response_directly/tutorial001.py!}
```

!!! note
    Notice that you import it directly from `starlette.responses`, not from `fastapi`.

## Returning a custom `Response`

The example above shows all the parts you need, but it's not very useful yet, as you could have just returned the `item` directly, and **FastAPI** would put it in a `JSONResponse` for you, converting it to a `dict`, etc. All that by default.

Now, let's see how you could use that to return a custom response.

Let's say you want to return a response that is not available in the default <a href="https://www.starlette.io/responses/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette `Response`s</a>.

Let's say that you want to return <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" class="external-link" target="_blank">XML</a>.

You could put your XML content in a string, put it in a Starlette Response, and return it:

```Python hl_lines="2 20"
{!./src/response_directly/tutorial002.py!}
```

## Notes

When you return a `Response` directly its data is not validated, converted (serialized), nor documented automatically.

But you can still <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/additional-responses/" target="_blank">document it</a>.

In the next sections you will see how to use/declare these custom `Response`s while still having automatic data conversion, documentation, etc.

You will also see how to use them to set response Headers and Cookies.
